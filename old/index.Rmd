<!-- ## About me `r emo::ji('woman_technologist')` -->
<br/>


I'm a computational biologist working on statistical methods and best practices for analyzing single-cell omics data. I recently obtained my PhD at the [Cellular Genetics programme](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/cellular-genetics/) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and the University of Cambridge, working between the groups of [Sarah Teichmann](http://www.teichlab.org/) and [John Marioni](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/marioni). 

My research focuses on quantifying differences between biological conditions in single-cell data, optimizing the use of cell atlases, and characterizing disease-related cell states, with a focus on human tissue immunology. Here is a list of [publications](https://emdann.github.io/pubs.html).

My work relies on open science, sharing of resources and know-how. I am a core member of the [scverse consortium](scverse.org), developing and maintaining foundational tools for omics data analysis in python.

<!-- I make [open source software](https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloR), [analysis workflows](https://github.com/MarioniLab/oor_benchmark) and [curate data resources](https://github.com/Teichlab/Pan_fetal_immune#mapping-the-developing-human-immune-system-across-organs.). -->
I enjoy several activities and I excel at none: watching movies, reading fiction, board games, cooking, running, cycling, petting dogs. I grew up in Ferrara.
